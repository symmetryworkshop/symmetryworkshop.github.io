Alex Hernandez-Garcia,"Postdoctoral researcher at Mila and the Université de Montréal, working with Prof. Yoshua Bengio. His research interests are interdisciplinary: he has worked at the intersection of ML and computational neuroscience, studying the role of data augmentation in neural networks and its connection to representational invariance in the human brain. Currently, he is interested in applications of machine learning for fighting climate change.",alex.hernandez-garcia@mila.quebec,alexhernandezgarcia.github.io,"Mila, Université de Montréal",https://twitter.com/alexhdezgcia,he/him/él,alex_photo_800px.jpg (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ec8bdf56c87a60264c374bb027f073da/75adbe43/alex_photo_800px.jpg)
Edgar Dobriban,"Assistant Professor in the Statistics Department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. His interests include theoretical machine learning and statistics for ``big data''. He has co-organized (with Kostas Daniilidis) the one-day Workshop on Equivariance and Data Augmentation in 2020.",dobriban@wharton.upenn.edu,statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dobriban,"University of Pennsylvania",https://twitter.com/EdgarDobriban,,
Haggai Maron,"Research Scientist at NVIDIA Research and an incoming Assistant Professor at the faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Technion, Israel. He is working on applying deep learning to structured domains like graphs, point clouds, and surfaces. He has a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from the Weizmann Institute of Science. He co-organized the Israeli Geometric Deep Learning workshops (IGDL2020/IGDL2021)",hmaron@nvidia.com,https://haggaim.github.io,NVIDIA,,,
Robin Walters,"Postdoctoral researcher in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University.  His work is on using representation theory and deep learning to solve differential equations and conversely using differential equations and deep learning to better understand symmetry.  He has a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Chicago.",rwalters@northeastern.edu,http://mathserver.neu.edu/robin,Northeastern University,,,
Rose Yu,"Assistant Professor at Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. Previously, she was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech. She earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. Her research focuses on machine learning for large-scale spatiotemporal data, with a particular emphasis on physics-guided AI. She has won  Faculty Research Award from Google, Amazon and Adobe and Best Dissertation Award. She was the co-organizer of KITP conference: At the Crossroad of Physics and Machine Learning, and several ICML/NeurIPS Time Series workshops.",roseyu@ucsd.edu,http://roseyu.com,"University of California, San Diego",,,
Taco Cohen,"Machine learning researcher at Qualcomm. He received a BSc in Computer Science from Utrecht University and a MSc in AI and PhD in Machine Learning (with Max Welling) from the University of Amsterdam. His research is focused on learning of equivariant representations for data-efficient deep learning. He co-organized several related workshops and is a coauthor of a recent book titled Geometric Deep Learning.",taco.cohen@gmail.com,https://tacocohen.wordpress.com,Qualcomm,,,
