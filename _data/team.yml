  bio: "Postdoctoral researcher at Mila and the Universit\xE9 de Montr\xE9al, working\
    \ with Prof. Yoshua Bengio. His research interests are interdisciplinary: he has\
    \ worked at the intersection of ML and computational neuroscience, studying the\
    \ role of data augmentation in neural networks and its connection to representational\
    \ invariance in the human brain. Currently, he is interested in applications of\
    \ machine learning for fighting climate change."
