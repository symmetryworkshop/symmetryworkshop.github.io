subtitle: Symmetry and equivariance in learning algorithms and data

Symmetry and equivariance are fundamental to the success of deep learning. In the last few years, encoding symmetry information in neural architectures, in most cases in the form of constructing equivariant networks, has become a key design principle when designing efficient neural networks for structured and complex data. In parallel, symmetry is ubiquitous in science, not only in crystallography and quantum theory, where its role has long been explicitly recognized, but also in chemistry, biology, and others. Unfortunately, symmetry and equivariance are often studied by different communities in isolation, missing out on fruitful synergies and interactions. This workshop aims to bring together researchers at the forefront of symmetry and equivariance from machine learning, statistics, mathematics, and the broader scientific community. The goal of the workshop is to nurture the community of researchers working at the intersection of deep learning, representation theory, and physical science areas, by providing a platform to share ideas from diverse fields and shape the vision of the rapidly growing field of symmetry and equivariance.
